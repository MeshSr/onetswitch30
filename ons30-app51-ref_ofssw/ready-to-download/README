This init.sh script runs the startup configurations for the MeshSr OpenFlow switch reference design.
For either the OFS-SW(software flow tables ONLY) or the OFS-HW(with FPGA hardware flow tables), the script
1. configures the network interfaces, such as IP address, MAC address, etc.
2. starts the OpenFlow software on the switch, sets up udatapath and secchan.

NOTE
1. This script should be put in the root of the FAT partition, without renaming.

2. Change the MAC/IP address according to your environment.
   The default MAC address of the ethernet interfaces are derived from 'switch_ip'.
   You can modify them especially when you setup a bigger network with several devices.

3. Default entries are explicitly added by dpctl in OFS-SW.
   ./utilities/dpctl tcp:$local_ip:$local_port flow-mod cmd=add,table=0,prio=0 apply goto:1
   ./utilities/dpctl tcp:$local_ip:$local_port flow-mod cmd=add,table=1,prio=0 apply goto:2
   ./utilities/dpctl tcp:$local_ip:$local_port flow-mod cmd=add,table=2,prio=0 apply goto:3

   The pkt-in entry from controller's logic is always be handled by the switch's software.
   In OFS-SW, all the tables are software-implemented so the pkt-in can be handled in any # of table.
   While in OFS-HW, it has to be written into the first software-implemented table. i.e. Table #3 of ONetSwitch30/45 or Table #1 of ONetSwitch20.

   Adding these entries keeps the consistency between OFS-SW and OFS-HW, but is not a must when running OFS-SW ONLY or OFS-HW ONLY in your scenario.
   You can remove these default entries if you want.
